# JSometric #
JSometric aims to be an isometric map renderer in Javacsript. It is currently
only in "proof of concept"-stage.

The goal is to make it somewhat independent of drawing method, ie. generic
enough to support eg. both raw HTML and the HTML5 Canvas.

**Please note that this is in very very early development. Alot of things are
 broken**
